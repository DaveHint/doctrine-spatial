Installation
============

Installation via composer
-------------------------

Add the `longitude-one/doctrine-spatial` package in your composer.json.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require longitude-one/doctrine-spatial

Or you can edit directly `composer.json` file by adding this line on your requirements:

.. code-block:: json

    "require": {
        "longitude-one/doctrine-spatial": "^5.0"

Installation without composer
-----------------------------

While Composer is the recommended method for library management, you can
:download:`download the library  <https://github.com/longitude-one/doctrine-spatial/archive/master.zip>` manually
if needed.
Once downloaded, locate the directory within the archive named `lib`.
This directory typically contains the library's core files. Copy and paste this lib directory into the location where
you store all your application's libraries.
